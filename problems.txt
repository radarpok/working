to solve:
    - fix react error in powershell - why npm/yarn start is throwing an error
    //  err message: 'react-scripts' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
         operable program or batch file. error Command failed with exit code 1.
    //  excluded reasons:
         start script is missing/undefined: it is there and defined
         second script key in package.json: there is only one
         yarn/npm version is out of date: both version is up to date
         host is set incorrectly: figuring out what a properly set host means

solved:
    - make touch prompt work in powershell
    // defining it's function manually did the trick
